# How AI Agents *Really* Work: A Developer's Guide to the ReAct Loop

## The Problem: "The Agent Reasons" is Not Enough

As developers, we're often told that AI agents can "reason," "plan," and "learn." While true at a high level, these terms are ambiguous and hide the underlying mechanics. How does an agent *actually* reason? What does it mean when it "decides" to use a tool?

This project demystifies the agent by focusing on its core engine: the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) loop**. Using a simple weather forecaster built with the Akka SDK, we'll provide a developer-focused look at how these components work together to create the illusion of thought.

## Deconstructing the Agent: It's a Team, Not a Monolith

An "agent" is not a single thing; it's an architecture composed of distinct parts working in concert. The agent itself doesn't reason—its internal components do. Understanding this separation of concerns is the key to building them.

There are four core components:

### 1. The Model (The Brain)

This is the Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4). **This is where the reasoning happens.** The model is responsible for:

- Understanding the user's request.
- Forming "thoughts" or plans on how to respond.
- Deciding *which* specific tool to call to get more information.
- Determining the *exact parameters* to pass to that tool.
- Interpreting the output from a tool and deciding the next step.

When we say an "agent thinks," we mean that the **orchestrator has passed the current context to the model, and the model has returned a structured response indicating a thought process or a decision to call a tool.**

### 2. The Tools (The Hands)

These are the functions and APIs that the agent can call to interact with the outside world. **This is how the agent acts.** Tools are what make an agent useful; they are what allow it to:

- Fetch live data (e.g., `weatherForecast`).
- Connect to external systems (databases, CRMs, etc.).
- Perform specific, programmatic actions.

An agent's capabilities are defined entirely by the tools you give it.

### 3. Context Memory (The Short-Term Memory)

This is the information store that maintains the state of the conversation. It holds:

- The initial system prompt (the agent's instructions).
- The history of user messages.
- The results of every tool call.

The orchestrator feeds this memory to the model on every turn, which is how the model maintains context across multiple steps.

### 4. The Orchestrator (The Conductor)

The orchestrator is the code that runs the ReAct loop itself. It is the "manager" that directs traffic between the other components. Its logic is simple:

- **Step 1:** Send the latest user message and the entire context memory to the model.
- **Step 2:** Look at the model's response.
  - If the model wants to call a tool, the orchestrator executes that tool call. It then adds the result to memory and starts the loop over.
  - If the model provides a final answer, the orchestrator sends it to the user.

**The Akka SDK provides this orchestrator out-of-the-box.** This is its key advantage: it handles the complex, repetitive loop, allowing you to focus on implementing the tools (your business logic) and defining the model's goals.

## The ReAct Loop in Action: The Weather Bot Example

Let's trace the ReAct loop for the query: *"What should I wear and do today?"*

The agent has four tools: `weatherForecast`, `activitySuggestions`, `clothingRecommendations`, and `travelAdvice`.

### Loop 1: Getting the Weather

1. **Orchestrator:** Sends the user's query to the model.
2. **Model Reasons:** "I can't answer about clothing or activities without the weather. My first step is to get the forecast. I need to call the `weatherForecast` tool."
3. **Orchestrator Acts:** Executes `weatherForecast(location: "current location", date: "today")`.
4. **Observation:** The tool returns `{ "weather": "Sunny", "temperature": "15-25°C" }`. The orchestrator adds this result to the context memory.

### Loop 2: Getting Activity Ideas

1. **Orchestrator:** Sends the original query *and* the new weather data to the model.
2. **Model Reasons:** "The weather is sunny. Now I need activity ideas. I should call `activitySuggestions`."
3. **Orchestrator Acts:** Executes `activitySuggestions(weather: "Sunny", temperature: "15-25°C")`.
4. **Observation:** The tool returns a list of activities, including `"Outdoor walking or hiking"`. This is added to memory.

### Loop 3: Getting Specific Clothing Advice

1. **Orchestrator:** Sends the query, weather, and activity list to the model.
2. **Model Reasons:** "The user wants to know what to wear. Hiking is a good activity. I need specific clothing advice for hiking in this weather. I must call `clothingRecommendations`."
3. **Orchestrator Acts:** Executes `clothingRecommendations(weather: "Sunny", activity: "Outdoor walking or hiking")`.
4. **Observation:** The tool returns clothing advice. This is added to memory.

### Loop 4: Synthesizing the Final Answer

1. **Orchestrator:** Sends the full context (query, weather, activities, clothing advice) to the model.
2. **Model Reasons:** "I now have all the pieces to answer the user's original question. I do not need to call any more tools. I will synthesize this information into a final response."
3. **Orchestrator Acts:** Sees the model has provided a final answer and sends it to the user. The loop concludes.

This step-by-step process, managed by the orchestrator, is the "thinking" of the agent.

## The Akka SDK Advantage: Focusing on What Matters

As we've seen, the power of an agent comes from the interplay between the model, tools, and a stateful orchestrator running the ReAct loop. Building this orchestration logic from scratch is complex. It involves managing conversation state, handling tool call requests and responses, and feeding the correct context to the model at each step.

This is where the Akka SDK comes in.

The Akka SDK provides the agent orchestrator as a managed service. By using Akka, you get:

- **Automated ReAct Loop:** Akka runs the entire Reason-Act cycle, so you don't have to build the loop logic.
- **Stateful Context Management:** It automatically manages the agent's memory, ensuring the model has the right context for each decision.
- **Seamless Tool Integration:** Akka handles the mechanics of calling your tools and returning the results to the model.

This allows you to focus on what makes your agent unique:
- **Implementing the Tools:** Your core business logic.
- **Defining the Agent's Goals:** Your system prompt and high-level instructions.

## Running the Demo

You can observe this ReAct loop yourself by running the application and watching the logs.

1. **Run the service:**

 ```sh
 mvn compile exec:java
 ```

2. **Use the test script in a separate terminal:**

 ```sh
 ./forecast.sh alice "What should I wear and do today?"
 ```

3. **Watch the logs:** You will see the agent logging each step of the ReAct cycle, showing how the model's "thoughts" lead to specific tool calls, one after another.
